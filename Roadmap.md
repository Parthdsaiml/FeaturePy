## 🚀 **FeaturePy Roadmap (4-Week Plan)**  

### 🔥 **Week 1: Core Feature Engineering Module**  
🔹 **Preprocessing Essentials**  
  - Missing value handling (mean, median, mode, KNN, iterative)  
  - Outlier detection & treatment (IQR, Z-score, isolation forests)  

🔹 **Feature Type Detection**  
  - Numerical vs. categorical  
  - Ordinal vs. nominal (your clustering + outlier-tolerant approach)  

🔹 **Testing & Debugging**  
  - Validate on small datasets  
  - Unit tests for correctness  

### 🔥 **Week 2: Feature Transformations & Selection**  
🔹 **Feature Encoding & Scaling**  
  - One-hot, ordinal encoding  
  - Standardization, MinMax scaling  
  - Log/square root transforms  

🔹 **Feature Selection Methods**  
  - Correlation-based removal  
  - Lasso regression feature selection  
  - Backward/forward selection  
  - Exhaustive search (2ⁿ-1 models, only for small datasets)  

🔹 **Benchmarking**  
  - Compare different scaling/selection methods on real-world datasets  

### 🔥 **Week 3: Model Selection + Automation Layer**  
🔹 **Auto Model Selection**  
  - Take sample (e.g., 20%) → Train multiple models → Rank them  
  - Store best-performing model → Repeat on different feature sets  
  - Explain why a model was chosen  

🔹 **Pipeline Integration**  
  - Automate feature engineering + model selection  
  - Ensure easy API-like usage (e.g., `FeaturePy.transform(X)`)  

🔹 **Performance Metrics & Explainability**  
  - Log feature selection impact  
  - Visualize feature importance  

### 🔥 **Week 4: Refinement & MVP Release**  
🔹 **Code Cleanup & Optimization**  
  - Refactor for efficiency  
  - Parallel processing for heavy tasks  

🔹 **Documentation & Tutorials**  
  - Create Jupyter notebooks  
  - Explain decisions with examples  

🔹 **Release MVP**  
  - Publish on GitHub/PyPi  
  - Write launch post & share in ML communities

## ⚡ **My Advice: Don’t Overcomplicate!**  
- **MVP First** → Get a working version out, even if it’s not "perfect."  
- **No Rabbit Holes** → If something works 80%, move on (e.g., don’t over-optimize ordinal detection).  
- **Feedback Loop** → Push an early version & get feedback instead of perfecting in isolation.  
- **Reuse Existing Work** → Don’t reinvent feature selection algorithms—wrap them smartly.
